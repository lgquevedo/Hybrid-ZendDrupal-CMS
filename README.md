# Hybrid-ZendDrupal-CMS
A Content Management System founded on Zendframework 2.3 and inspired by Drupal

This project will be wroten overwriting the zendframework's skeleton application module and adding a couple of tools' modules to have full admin control separated from contents.

We hope it has the power of zend as a php coder and the usual extensibility, theming and funcionalities tipicals on Drupal.

As a first step we'll create a installer to set a default database, a superuser account, and a session manager runing.
